AP-YonhapJury selection in the fraud trial of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes began Tuesday, casting a spotlight on the fallen Silicon Valley star now facing felony charges alleging she duped elite financial backers, customers and patients into believing that her startup was about to revolutionize medicine.But the Theranos technology, which promised to run hundreds of medical tests using a single drop of blood, never lived up to expectations, and may never have worked at all.Once a jury is seated, the trial will begin in San Jose, California, with opening arguments scheduled early next week. The trial will revolve around the rise and fall of Theranos, a startup that Holmes launched after dropping out of Stanford University in 2003.At one point, it looked like Holmes might realize her lofty ambitions of becoming the next Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder she embraced as a role model. Not that long ago, business magazines hailed the similarities, featuring Holmes in cover stories about her vision and her estimated fortune $4.5 billion based on her stake in Theranos. But Theranos _ a name derived from the words \"therapy\" and \"diagnosis\" _ quickly lost steam after revelations that its supposedly breakthrough blood-testing machine, called \"Edison\" didn\\'t work as Holmes had described and produced dangerously inaccurate results in tests run for actual patients.Holmes now faces the prospect of being remembered more like Bernie Madoff, the once-revered New York financier whose name became synonymous with fraud after he pled guilty to bilking billions of dollars through an illegal Ponzi scheme. If convicted, Holmes, now 37, could be sentenced to as much as 20 years in prison.Holmes, who was in court Tuesday, has maintained her innocence since the U.S. government charged her in 2018. Her trial was delayed by the pandemic and then a pregnancy that culminated in the recent birth of a son. Some legal observers believe that could make her a more sympathetic figure before the jury.Jury selection is expected to take several days. Holmes\\' saga has received wide attention thanks to a book by a Wall Street Journal investigative reporter whose newspaper stories led to her company\\'s downfall and an HBO documentary called \"The Inventor.\" She is also about to become the subject of a TV miniseries called \"The Dropout,\" starring Amanda Seyfried as Holmes.More than 200 people were summoned for the jury pool in an effort to seat an impartial panel.Over the course of the next three months, the trial is expected to provide moments of high drama, featuring a cast of billionaire Theranos investors and influential figures that sat on the company\\'s board.Investors who contributed much of the roughly $900 million that Theranos raised include media magnate Rupert Murdoch, Walmart\\'s Walton family, the family of former U.S. Education Secretary Becky DeVos and Mexican business mogul Carlos Slim. Theranos\\' well(equals)connected board included former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Defense Secretary Gen. James Mattis, former U.S. Secretary of State and former U.S. Treasury Secretary George Shultz (now deceased) and former Wells Fargo Bank CEO Richard Kovacevich.Holmes also may take the witness stand to defend herself, based on court documents filed leading up to the trial. If she does, her lawyers have indicated in recently unsealed filings that she will testify that some of her statements and actions while running Theranos were the result of \"intimate partner abuse\" inflicted by the company\\'s chief operating officer and her secret lover, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, who is facing multiple fraud charges in a separate trial.Balwani\\'s attorney has denied Holmes\\' allegations.

A series of key events are scheduled, including the 30th anniversary of the simultaneous admission of South and North Korea into the United Nations on Sept. 18, and the third anniversary of the Sept. 19 Pyongyang Declaration, signed by Moon and North Korea leader Kim Jong-un. These occasions may open opportunities for Moon to send another peace message toward the Kim regime and to expect corresponding responses.On the other hand, there are chances for the Kim regime to showcase its military strength or heighten bellicose rhetoric in another series of key events, such as North Korea\\'s Foundation Day on Sept. 9 or the Supreme People\\'s Assembly on Sept. 28. According to Cheong Wa Dae, Wednesday, the presidential office has yet to make a decision on Moon\\'s visit to the U.N. headquarters in New York, for the U.N. General Assembly\\'s General Debate that will start on Sept. 21. During his New Year speech in January, Moon stressed that this year marks the 30th anniversary of both Koreas\\' admission into the U.N. and that \"the two Koreas should prove together that the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula can be a help to the global community.\" Given this remark, Moon is expected to deliver messages of peace to the North, regardless of his visit to New York, and to ask other U.N. members to continue their support for his peace initiative, while urging North Korea to engage in talks.The third anniversary of the Pyongyang Declaration is also an opportunity for Moon to persuade North Korea to return to talks. During their summit in Pyongyang three years ago, Moon and Kim shared their views that the Korean Peninsula must be \"turned into a land of peace\" and agreed to \"cooperate closely in the process of pursuing the complete denuclearization\" of the peninsula. As an annex to the declaration, the two sides adopted the Comprehensive Military Agreement, in which the two Koreas would halt all hostile acts against each other and set buffer zones along their air, land and sea borders to reduce tensions and prevent accidental clashes. In doing so, the leaders also agreed to activate the Inter-Korean Joint Military Committee.However, the committee has yet to have been organized, and the effectiveness of the agreement is being questioned following a number of provocations, such as the North\\'s sudden demolition of the inter-Korean liaison office in Gaeseong last year, as well as continued cyberattacks on strategically important South Korean organizations. Last month, Kim Yo-jong, sister of leader Kim Jong-un, threatened to abolish the agreement in protest against the joint military exercises between Seoul and Washington.\"If Seoul sends messages to the North, it will likely be about requesting Pyongyang to respond to Seoul\\'s calls through communication lines first,\" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies. \"And then, it will urge the North to implement the Comprehensive Military Agreement and to activate the Inter-Korean Joint Military Committee.\"Soldiers march during a military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the foundation of North Korea in Pyongyang, Sept. 9, 2018. Korea Times fileAgainst this backdrop, Pyongyang also has a number of key events fixed for this month. On Sept. 9, North Korea will celebrate the 73th anniversary of the regime\\'s foundation, which is expected to be accompanied by various events that could raise tensions. In the 2016 edition of this anniversary, the North conducted a nuclear detonation test at its Punggye-ri test site, marking its fifth but not final test. Though experts say that the chances are slim for the North to conduct a nuclear test this year, the situation is building up similarly. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in an Aug. 27 report that there were signs indicating that North Korea has restarted its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The report noted that there were new indications of the operation of a radiochemical laboratory, which is in charge of the reprocessing of nuclear fuels, a process required for producing plutonium. \"Though there were previous military provocations around the Foundation Day, chances are slim for the North to jump to a nuclear test right away, given the current stalemate in inter-Korean and U.S.-North Korea circumstances,\" Yang said. \"Also, there are no signs of the Kim regime preparing a massive military parade right now. If there\\'s any provocation, a test fire of new short-range ballistic missiles might be possible.\" The Supreme People\\'s Assembly on Sept. 28 could also be an important event in inter-Korean relations down the road. The assembly is considered to be an organization that makes decisions on North Korea\\'s internal affairs, such as laws and budgets, but there is a chance of the North using it as an event to reaffirm its commitment to its nuclear program and hardline strategies against the U.S.', 'category': 'nation', 'source': 'koreatimes', 'scrap_time': '2021-09-03 05:17:15'}\n"

Sept. 9 is North Korea\\'s Foundation Day. YonhapEvents marking joint UN admission, North Korea foundation scheduledBy Nam Hyun-wooThis September will mark an important month for the Moon Jae-in administration, as it is making its final efforts to improve inter-Korean relations before the President\\'s term ends in May. A series of key events are scheduled, including the 30th anniversary of the simultaneous admission of South and North Korea into the United Nations on Sept. 18, and the third anniversary of the Sept. 19 Pyongyang Declaration, signed by Moon and North Korea leader Kim Jong-un. These occasions may open opportunities for Moon to send another peace message toward the Kim regime and to expect corresponding responses.On the other hand, there are chances for the Kim regime to showcase its military strength or heighten bellicose rhetoric in another series of key events, such as North Korea\\'s Foundation Day on Sept. 9 or the Supreme People\\'s Assembly on Sept. 28. According to Cheong Wa Dae, Wednesday, the presidential office has yet to make a decision on Moon\\'s visit to the U.N. headquarters in New York, for the U.N. General Assembly\\'s General Debate that will start on Sept. 21. During his New Year speech in January, Moon stressed that this year marks the 30th anniversary of both Koreas\\' admission into the U.N. and that \"the two Koreas should prove together that the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula can be a help to the global community.\" Given this remark, Moon is expected to deliver messages of peace to the North, regardless of his visit to New York, and to ask other U.N. members to continue their support for his peace initiative, while urging North Korea to engage in talks.The third anniversary of the Pyongyang Declaration is also an opportunity for Moon to persuade North Korea to return to talks. During their summit in Pyongyang three years ago, Moon and Kim shared their views that the Korean Peninsula must be \"turned into a land of peace\" and agreed to \"cooperate closely in the process of pursuing the complete denuclearization\" of the peninsula. As an annex to the declaration, the two sides adopted the Comprehensive Military Agreement, in which the two Koreas would halt all hostile acts against each other and set buffer zones along their air, land and sea borders to reduce tensions and prevent accidental clashes. In doing so, the leaders also agreed to activate the Inter-Korean Joint Military Committee.However, the committee has yet to have been organized, and the effectiveness of the agreement is being questioned following a number of provocations, such as the North\\'s sudden demolition of the inter-Korean liaison office in Gaeseong last year, as well as continued cyberattacks on strategically important South Korean organizations.

Quite a number of candidates have a legal background, serving as lawyers, prosecutors or judges before they joined politics, and they have a stronger presence in public opinion surveys. Gyeonggi Governor Lee Jae-myung was a lawyer before he was elected mayor of Seongnam City, and then governor of Gyeonggi Province. His rival Yoon Seok-youl of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP) served as prosecutor general, although he himself chose to cut his tenure short in a show of resistance to President Moon Jae-in. Lee and Yun have been two frontrunners in recent polls. Choi Jae-hyung, a PPP presidential contender, served as a judge before he took the helm of the Board of Audit and Inspection. Another PPP contender Hwang Kyo-ahn served as a prosecutor for several decades before he was tapped for the position of justice minister and then prime minister under the Park Geun-hye government. Outspoken presidential candidate Hong Joon-pyo was a prosecutor, whereas former Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae began her career as a judge after she passed the state bar exam. I think people with a background in law gaining the upper hand in this presidential election is not a coincidence. Rather it may have something to do with the direction in which this country is heading.When the economy is mired in recession, voters want a strong, visionary leader with a proven record in business or the economy, hoping that they can help revive the troubled economy. Likewise, when justice is endangered, candidates with a legal background may find it easier to appeal to the hearts and minds of voters than candidates of any other career backgrounds. Some presidential candidates\\' rhetoric during their press conferences to declare their presidential bids reflects this sentiment. Instead of uttering their personal ambitions as a key driver behind declaring their presidential bid, these candidates remarked that they were called upon by the public to join the presidential election to rescue the country in peril.Yoon, for example, said he joined the presidential race to restore free democracy and rule of law, accusing the Moon Jae-in government of having dismantled these values. \"Since I resigned from the position of prosecutor general in March, I\\'ve met many people from all walks of life. They all were worried about the future of this country and asking if this country would be okay,\" he said on June 29 while declaring officially his bid to run in the election. Mentioning the public\\'s unwavering support for him even after he stepped down from the key post, he said the public\\'s support and encouragement showed they wanted him to play a role in governmental change.Choi made similar remarks. He said he chose to leave the Board of Audit and Inspection six months before the end of his tenure and joined the presidential race to save the country from crisis. He claimed President Moon\\'s mismanagement of the economy and squandering of taxpayer money to curry favor with his supporters were some of the root causes of the problems. The 2022 presidential election won\\'t be all that different from previous ones, when it comes to the \"format of competition.\" Once the ruling and main opposition parties successfully field their presidential candidates through primaries, a two-way race between them will be inevitable. Then the ball will be in the court of the voters. Nobody knows which candidate will win their parties\\' nominations. But as voters, we all need to have our own criteria about our decision in 2022. I roughly have mine. I won\\'t consider candidates who habitually use big words, exaggerate or brag of their credentials, or who make empty promises. I also won\\'t cast my ballot for a candidate if I have no idea how they lived their lives before entering politics. In my experience, candidates who will pledge anything to be elected or make great-but-ambiguous promises, such as \"overhauling the nation or the economy,\" are another group of dangerous people who can abuse power, if elected. I will vote for a candidate who presents realistic goals and a thoroughly defined role as a person in the top government job. Rather than painting himself or herself as a superhero, the ideal candidate would self-identify as a manager of the nation and try hard to let the system work for all, rather than pushing for ambitious experimental projects. I think South Korea is an advanced country with a strong system in place. What the person in the top job has to do is let it work.Being an effective manager itself requires people to have a considerable level of prior experience and knowledge.

      "{'url': 'http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2021/09/137_314749.html', 'title': 'Repairing Korea-Japan relations for good ', 'subtitle': '', 'date': '2021-09-01', 'content': 'By Edward Jeong-hoon Song (Student at the Korean Minjok Leadership Academy)\"CLOSING SALE,\" reads a one-story-high poster on the wall outside of Uniqlo\\'s flagship store in Seoul. The \"Boycott Japan\" campaign had started in the summer of 2019 and even Uniqlo could not withstand the tsunami of anti-Japanese sentiment that swept away 50 percent of Uniqlo\\'s revenue in 2019, 34 of its stores in 2020, and at least 10 more stores in 2021. Tension between Korea and Japan is old news. After Japan\\'s colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula was shattered by Japan\\'s defeat in World War II, it took almost 20 years before the two countries restored diplomatic relations in 1965. Diplomatic restoration opened the door for a thawing relationship. Japan\\'s cultural influence grew through the introduction of Japanese movies, animations and video games. Korean children who grew up with Mario and Naruto tended to view Japan more favorably than their parents, and trade had been booming for over a decade. The current conflict between Korea and Japan is all the more alarming because of the good relations that had previously prevailed. Following an October 2018 decision by the Korean Supreme Court requiring Nippon Steel to compensate surviving South Koreans who had been forced to work in the Japanese company\\'s facilities during World War II, Korean courts handed down a series of similar rulings against other Japanese corporations. In return, Japan tightened export control rules on strategic materials exported to South Korea. The economic effects of the disagreement between the two countries have been staggering. The Korea Press Foundation reported that in 2019, nearly 80 percent of Koreans intentionally avoided purchasing Japanese goods. In 2020, Koreans\\' unfavorable views of Japan jumped by almost 22 percentage points, according to the East Asia Institute. The Japan National Tourism Organization claims that the number of Koreans visiting Japan fell by half, even before the pandemic. Koreans generally do not believe that they are overly swayed by nationalism or ethnic racism. Indeed, Koreans are known as supporters of human rights and democracy, and many supported the Black Lives Matter movement. As Michael Breen, a former correspondent for The Korea Times, has argued, anti-Japanese sentiment may boil down to education. Schools in contemporary Korea simultaneously emphasize the equality of humanity and the atrocities Koreans suffered under the Japanese colonial occupation. When the grim view of Japan espoused in textbooks is aggravated by geo-political tensions, the particular vilification of Japan seems to outweigh a mutual belief in commonalities.Still, there is some hope for a breakthrough. In line with the Biden administration\\'s emphasis on improving the relations between Korea and Japan to counter escalating tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, President Moon Jae-in announced in August that his government is ready to enter talks with his Japanese counterpart. As former Korean Ambassador to Japan Shin Kak-soo notes, \"Both countries can cooperate in multiple areas, including taking preventive measures against COVID-19 and spurring economic recovery.\"Any changes need to cut deeper than momentary shifts of policy pursued by revolving administrations.

      "{'url': 'http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2021/09/137_314794.html', 'title': 'Everything we know about work is wrong. Pandemic proved it. ', 'subtitle': '', 'date': '2021-09-01', 'content': 'By John L. MicekSo what can the plight of a little cafe tell you about the state of the American economy and the changing face of work? A lot, as it turns out.The other week, the bistro where my family and I have been grabbing brunch every Sunday since the start of the pandemic announced that it would be shuttering on weekends, and shifting to a more limited, weekday schedule. The reason was a familiar one: The owner couldn\\'t find the staff they needed to both function effectively and to keep themselves and their current staff from being ground into dust from the punishing pace.The news was heartbreaking, if entirely unsurprising. Employers across the nation are struggling with a labor shortage so profound that one Alabama pizzeria vowed to hire \"literally anyone\" just to keep the doors open, according to Business Insider.Business leaders have falsely blamed the crisis on generous pandemic unemployment benefits, arguing that they\\'re a disincentive to return to the labor force. Study after study has proven this is not the case. Instead, more seismic forces are at work.In April of this year, a staggering 4 million people quit their jobs, in a phenomenon that\\'s come to be called \"The Great Resignation,\" Vox reported.It\\'s not that people don\\'t want to work, but rather it\\'s that, after an earth-shattering 16 months that have seen hundreds of thousands of our family members, friends, and neighbors die at the hands of an implacable and indiscriminate foe, there\\'s just a genuine question of whether grinding it out for 40 hours a week at a job with substandard pay, low benefits, and little work-home balance is really worth it.Increasingly, the answer is a resounding \"No.\"Hospitality and leisure workers, who staff restaurants, bars, and hotels, and who had to bear the brunt of pandemic-induced rage for low wages and little dignity, are leading that exodus. In April, the sector lost more than 740,000 people.In the midst of the pandemic, workers across industries discovered something: When they weren\\'t tethered to desks or jobs, there was time for something miraculous: Family and community, the hobby they\\'d been putting off learning, the time to retrain and search for new, and more fulfilling, work.Admittedly, not everyone had this luxury, working parents had to scramble to find child care, or balance the demands of remote work against acting as their children\\'s homeroom teacher.The shift was particularly hard for low-income workers. Frontline workers didn\\'t have the luxury of stepping back at all.Even so, \"We have changed. Work has changed. The way we think about time and space has changed,\" Harvard Business School professor Tsedal Neeley told NPR. Having been given time and space and flexibility by the pandemic, workers now crave and demand it, she told NPR.And then, something else happened, because of unprecedented, direct payments from the federal government ― as much as $3,200 each ― the number of Americans in poverty began to fall, according to Vox, from 12.8 percent in 2018 to 8.5 percent. That\\'s based on projections that researchers at Columbia University made in March.Separate research by the Urban Institute, also cited by Vox, projected that 2021 poverty will be about 7 percent, nearly cutting the 2018 rate in half.The Biden White House\\'s child tax credit program, monthly payments of up to $300 per child to American families, is similarly expected to lift millions of children out of poverty. Republicans argue against such largess, saying it perpetuates the welfare state.It is hard to deny the bottom line reality: When you give people money, they are less poor, happier, and more likely to inject that money back into the economy. In fact, economists expect economic growth of about 7 percent this year, and 4.9 percent, in 2022, fueled by the stimulus and vaccines, Reuters reported.Good policy choices drive down poverty. And American workers, by now accustomed to the flexibility of the post-pandemic economy, and the regular flow of stimulus checks, are unlikely to want to backtrack on that.But it can\\'t end there. To help both employers and workers, Washington and Harrisburg need to step up and do a couple of things.One of them is finally making the wealthiest Americans, who grew even richer during the pandemic, pay their fair share.Earlier this week, new research by a coalition of Pennsylvania advocates showed that that if a wealth tax proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren had been in effect in 2020, \"the nation\\'s billionaires alone would have paid $114 billion for that year ― and would pay an estimated combined total of $1.4 trillion over 10 years.\"That would pay for roughly half the $3.5 trillion budget resolution backed by the Biden administration that would dramatically remake the post-pandemic economy. Approving it would pay for child care and a host of other programs that would enable Americans to go back to work in a sustainable and healthy way.We also need to stop tying health coverage and other benefits to employment. The United States stands nearly alone in tying health coverage and other key benefits to work.The pandemic proved that everything we know about work is wrong. And there\\'s no stepping back from it now.An award-winning political journalist, John L. Micek (jmicek@penncapital-star.com) is editor-in-chief of The Pennsylvania Capital-Star in Harrisburg, Pa.

My response to that question would be: \"Don\\'t worry, it will not happen. Afghanistan was such a unique case that is different from any of the other U.S. allies, except perhaps Vietnam of the early 1970s.\"One unique aspect of the U.S.-Afghanistan alliance is the reason why the alliance was formed to begin with. The U.S. troops went into Afghanistan to punish the perpetrators of 9/11 and to eradicate the Taliban regime, which gave sanctuary to Islamic extremist group al-Qaida and enabled them to organize and execute the 9/11 terrorist acts in 2001. The Taliban was driven out of power in 2001 and Osama bin Laden, the leader of the terrorist group, was killed in 2011. However, the U.S. could not eliminate the Taliban completely or build a functioning nation in Afghanistan. Other alliances, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a multilateral alliance, and bilateral alliances with Japan or South Korea were formed in order to deter and contain the U.S.\\'s rivals such as the Soviet Union before and China now, as well as to defend the U.S.\\'s allies from potential enemies. The main adversaries have not remained the same, but the need to deal with the rivals and defend the allies ― which the U.S. considers to be in its own best interest ― is still there.As America\\'s strategic competition with China has intensified, the need to strengthen alliances with existing allies has become greater. In Northeast Asia, as the capability of North Korean nuclear weapons and missiles has grown, even potentially threatening the U.S. mainland, the strategic value of the U.S.\\'s alliance with Japan and South Korea has increased.The second difference between Afghanistan and other U.S. allies is in the nature and predilection of the ally in question. Afghanistan was a fractured country among the leadership and between contending groups, which were more interested in enriching themselves than strengthening the country\\'s defense capabilities, and who lacked the will to fight the well-organized and indoctrinated enemy of the state that was the Taliban. The dictum in both Chinese and English, \"Heaven (God) helps those who help themselves,\" can be a universal one which also applies to the south central region of Asia.America could not protect Afghanistan from the revival and onslaught of the Taliban, not because of the lack of American will to help Afghanistan to continue the struggle, but because of the failure to find capable Afghan partners who are willing and able to help their own security.It is clear now that, in their own strategic interest and out of rational calculation, that the U.S. will not repeat the mistake of the past 20 years ― of continuing to send troops to Afghanistan ― longer than necessary to accomplish its objectives. A second issue that seems to have caused the erosion of confidence that the allies placed on the U.S. is whether Washington has adequately consulted and coordinated with them regarding the timing and method of action, when it comes down to critical decisions, such as the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. In February 2020, the Trump administration cut a deal with the Taliban, in which the U.S. agreed to get out of Afghanistan in 14 months and, in exchange, the Taliban agreed not to let Afghanistan become a haven for terrorists and to stop attacking U.S. service members. Actions taken by the two succeeding administrations (Trump and Biden) on Afghanistan unilaterally and without proper communication, left its partners with neither the time nor preparation to deal with the process and its consequences. In alliance diplomacy, nothing disappoints and upsets the partners as much as unilateralism and surprises in major decision making. It is possible that, despite the tragedy resulting from an inadequately prepared and executed withdrawal, it might prove to be a case of a \"blessing in disguise,\" as the situation evolved after the fall of Saigon in April of 1975. After ridding itself of the Afghan burden, the U.S. may be in a position to focus its attention and energy on issues and areas that really count ― relations with China and Russia, global warming, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and maintaining liberal and democratic order in the world. It will take much effort and time for its allies to recover from their loss in terms of the credibility of and confidence in the U.S. Even then, however, there are lessons that the U.S. should pay close attention to: it has to pay renewed attention to work closely with its allies on key issues, even after the fallout from this drop in the confidence in and credibility of the U.S. blows over in due time.Second, whether the detachment of the U.S. from Afghanistan will turn out to be a case of a blessing in disguise or another quagmire to contend with will be at the mercy of the Taliban, which may allow terrorist groups such as IS and al-Qaida to use Afghanistan as a sanctuary base for their destructive activities.

ShapiroThe horrific bombings outside the Kabul airport, which killed 13 American service members and scores of Afghans, bring two facts into stark relief.First, the Taliban will face challenges from more extreme groups. Second, the Taliban is divided. The attackers upended the aura of control the group's leaders want to present to the world. In all likelihood, they made it through multiple Taliban checkpoints to pull off the attack.Indeed, there is a new battle taking shape in Afghanistan ― this one within the Taliban political movement.On one side are senior leaders who understand the organization desperately needs foreign assistance if they wish to remain in power for more than a few months. The government is staring at economic collapse. It will lose more than $3 billion a year in support if all pledged international aid is withdrawn. Meanwhile, the Taliban lacks access to the $9 billion in the Afghan central bank's reserves, most of which is controlled by the U.S. and international institutions, and is already facing galloping inflation.The Taliban's $300 million to $1.6 billion in revenue from the opium trade won't go far to meet the government's $5.5 billion annual budget, especially as it faces a new insurgency and unrest in many areas of the country. Though increasing taxes on legal trade is certainly possible in the short run, doing so will make an already dire economic situation even worse.Stranded funds and limited alternatives create powerful pressures to moderate. Even leaving aside the Taliban's desperate need for international assistance and access to cash reserves, the group's 80,000 fighters cannot control a country of 38 million people without making some accommodations. That's why many Taliban leaders are making public statements about moderating policies toward women, respecting human rights and providing amnesty to those who worked for the government.At the same time, Afghans seeking to leave are being beaten and sometimes killed. The Taliban's stated policies were not followed at airport checkpoints, even before the announcement that Afghans would not be allowed to leave. Taliban squads are going house to house searching for those who worked for the government. And activists for the Hazara ethnic minority are being hunted and killed in Ghazni province and Kabul.Like any political movement, the Taliban has long contained diverse factions. Senior leaders such as Abdul Ghani Baradar, who oversees the organization's political affairs and met with CIA Director William Burns last week, have to strike a balance between different constituencies.And that creates challenges, because the Taliban's hard-line fighters do not want to moderate. From their perspective, the group just won an enormous victory against the international community, one that proves the strength of their ideology. They want to settle scores and govern according to a set of fundamentalist principles that do not allow women to participate in public life or any form of democracy.Little is known about Baradar's approach, but Mohammad Yaqoob, the military chief, and jurist Abdul Hakim, who led the group's negotiating team in Qatar, are believed to favor a pragmatic path. But another prominent military leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose terrorist network has long been subject to United Nations sanctions, is considered more extreme.The Taliban supreme commander, Haibatullah Akhundzada, reportedly separated control of the military between Yaqoob and Haqqani, both deputy supreme commanders, to prevent clashes.And the moderates cannot simply enforce their will, because struggles between moderate and extremist factions in Islamist political movements can turn deadly fast. The Taliban has been fighting bloody battles for years with Islamic State in Khorasan, a group currently recruiting Taliban fighters unhappy that the group negotiated the United States' peaceful withdrawal. One reason Islamic State fell in Syria is that the group's leadership had to battle extremists who believed that any accommodation or compromise with other governments and militias, however slight, was unacceptable.And even if extremist leaders fall in line, controlling their fighters is never easy. Islamic State's predecessor, al-Qaida in Iraq, struggled to keep the rank and file from engaging in counterproductive attacks, as have most violent political organizations for more than a century.What happens next in Afghanistan depends on who has the majority inside the Taliban movement ― the leaders cannot go against the majority without risking their own lives.If the moderates have the majority, they may be able to slowly rein in the terrible abuses we are now seeing and negotiate with the country's existing political elites to form a stable government.But if the extremists have the majority, the organization will not moderate, foreign aid will not flow, and the economy will collapse. Local militias will resist efforts to centralize power, as they have done for centuries. As extremists target ethnic minorities and modern lifestyles, more people will fight back, and it will take fewer financial resources for insurgents and outside powers to start new rebellions. And the Taliban will soon lose control over large parts of the country.Given that Taliban rank-and-file fighters are likely to be drawn from conservative rural areas and that those who have been imprisoned by the Afghan government will probably win prominent roles, I fear extremists will hold the majority. And that will mean no moderation, little aid, an inexorable slide into another round of fighting, and eventually a government with little power outside the Pashtun heartland where it has the most legitimacy.Jacob N.

YonhapBy Jung Da-minThe U.N. human rights body has pointed out the Korean ruling bloc\\'s push to revise the country\\'s media law to heavily penalize \"fake news\" may be in violation of an international human rights law and seriously infringe on freedom of opinion and expression. Irene Khan, a U.N. special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of freedom of opinion and expression, delivered an open letter to the Korean government regarding concerns over the revision bill to the Act on Press Arbitration, Aug. 27. The letter was made public on the website of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Wednesday (KST).The letter has come while the government and the ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) are seeking to revise the law to impose punitive damages on media outlets and reporters that produce so-called \"fake news.\" The DPK had planned to pass the bill at the National Assembly\\'s plenary session on Aug. 30, but put it off to Sept. 27 due to strong resistance from the opposition bloc and civic groups.In the letter, Khan said the revisions do not meet criteria to be a fair law, in terms of legality, necessity and proportionality. The U.N. special rapporteur said if the amendments are adopted at the National Assembly without further changes, they could severely restrict the rights to freedom of information and of expression of the media.The U.N. rapporteur also reiterated the Korean government\\'s obligation to respect and protect the rights to freedom of opinion and expression under article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), acceded to by the Korean government in April 1990.A poster jointly made by seven media-related organizations ― Korean Association of Newspapers, Journalists Association of Korea, Korea News Editors\\' Association, Korea Journalists\\' Club, Kwanhun Club, Korea Internet Newspaper Association and Korea Woman Journalists Association ― to protest the ruling Democratic Party of Korea\\'s push to revise a law allowing punitive damages on media outlets or reporters producing \"fake news.\" The organizations view the bill as an attempt to prevent reporting critical of those in political and economic power.\"Article 19 protects everyone\\'s right to opinion without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any media,\" the letter read. \"In particular, I want to stress that, under international human rights law, the prohibition of false information is not in itself a legitimate aim to restrict freedom of expression. In effect, people have the right to express ill-founded opinions or statements and indulge in parody or satire if they so wish.\"Khan said any limitation to disinformation must establish a close and concrete connection to the protection of one of the legitimate aims stated in ICCPR, such as respecting the rights and reputations of others and protecting national security, public order and public health or morals, but such a direct relationship seems absent in the law drafted by the DPK.She also said there is a concern that reporters could self-censor what they write to avoid what she said are \"excessive\" punitive damages when they should be in a position to freely criticize powerful figures, especially at this politically critical time as the country\\'s next presidential election is set to be held in March next year.', 'category': 'nation', 'source': 'koreatimes', 'scrap_time': '2021-09-03 05:17:58'}\n",

Over 130 victims filed a class action suit against a gimbap franchise following an incident in which 276 people who ate gimbap at two of its branches in Bundang District, Seongnam City between July 29 and Aug. 2 showed food poisoning symptoms. Around 40 of them were hospitalized for treatment.Another food poisoning incident occurred in Paju between Aug. 19 and 22, when 27 customers from a gimbap restaurant got sick, and most recently in Goyang on Aug. 23, in which 29 suffered symptoms such as fever and diarrhea. Among them, a female in her 20s died two days later. Park Ji-yeon, a mom of two kids in Seocho District, Seoul, said she is refraining from buying gimbap. \"I bought gimbap at least twice a week as a snack for my sons as I think it is nutritious, much better than cookies. I don\\'t think I will buy it until the weather gets cooler,\" she said.A gimbap restaurant owner in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, said sales at her store have dropped by nearly half due to food poisoning news. \"Even the customers who buy gimbap show their concern.

Salmonella bacteria, which is usually found in intestines of poultry and other animals, leads to symptoms such as diarrhea, fever and severe stomach cramps in human. It is the most common cause of food poisoning in the summer as around 37 degrees Celsius is the optimum temperature for the bacteria\\'s growth.

They could only selectively examine restaurants that had hygiene issues reported. One of the districts in Seoul, for example, checked 1,830 restaurants in 2019, but it checked only around 220 restaurants in the first half of this year, according to Hankook Ilbo. Following the food poisoning incidents, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ordered local governments to implement overall inspection on restaurants that sell gimbap.Choi Jeong-min, a gastroenterology professor at Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, said there should be more attention paid to hygiene the kitchen. \"At home, knives, cutting boards as well as ingredients should be washed with running water before use. Those utensil should be used separately for vegetables, meat and fish,\" he said.He also stressed preparing appropriate amounts of food so as to avoid leftovers. \"If there are leftovers, they should be kept in the refrigerator.

AP-YonhapChina\\'s armed forces can \"paralyze\" Taiwan\\'s defenses and are able to fully monitor its deployments, the island\\'s defense ministry said, offering a stark assessment of the rising threat posed by its giant neighbor.Beijing is stepping up military activities around the island, which it views as Chinese territory. It has never renounced the use of force to bring democratic Taiwan under its control.In its annual report to parliament on China\\'s military, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, Taiwan\\'s Defense Ministry presented a far graver view than it did last year, when the report said China still lacked the capability to launch a full assault on Taiwan.This year\\'s report said that China can launch what it termed \"soft and hard electronic attacks\", including blocking communications across the western part of the first island chain, the string of islands that run from the Japanese archipelago, through Taiwan and down to the Philippines.China \"can combine with its internet army to launch wired and wireless attacks against the global internet, which would initially paralyze our air defenses, command of the sea and counter-attack system abilities, presenting a huge threat to us\".China has also improved its reconnaissance abilities using Beidou, China\\'s answer to the U.S.-owned GPS navigation system, the ministry added.This means Beijing can monitor movements around Taiwan, helped by China\\'s regular use of its own spy planes, drones and intelligence gathering ships, it said.China\\'s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Although Taiwan\\'s report noted, like last year, that China still lacked transport abilities and logistical support for a large-scale invasion, the Chinese military is working to boost those abilities.With precision missile attacks that can hit anywhere on the island, China is also capable of \"paralyzing\" Taiwan military command centers and combat capacity of its naval and air forces, it said.Chinese spies in Taiwan could launch a \"decapitation strike\" to destroy political and economic infrastructure, it added.With the deployment of mid- and long-range missiles and more exercises involving its aircraft carriers, China is trying to position itself to delay \"foreign military intervention\" in an attack on Taiwan, the ministry said.President Tsai Ing-wen has made bolstering Taiwan\\'s own defenses a priority, building up its domestic defense industry and buying more equipment from the United States, the island\\'s most important arms supplier and international backer.

The used car industry demanded that the two carmakers sell only 110,000 used cars per year, while Hyundai Motor and other car brands demanded to be able to sell 250,000 cars per year.The used car dealers have opposed the domestic carmakers\\' bid to sell large quantities of used cars, claiming that the market share they are occupying will be taken away by the conglomerates.

YonhapWhile the government is planning to announce its final decision Friday, concerns are being raised amid no signs of a slowdown in the ongoing wave of COVID-19 infections.With the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant having led the fourth wave of the pandemic, new daily infections in recent weeks have been much higher than the figures around last year\\'s Chuseok holiday.Last year\\'s Chuseok fell on Oct. 1, when 77 daily cases were reported, with new daily infections hovering around 100, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).But now, daily cases have stayed above 1,000 for about two months, with the figure bouncing back to over 2,000, Tuesday, as the country added 2,025 more cases.The latest tally marked a sharp rise from 1,487 on Sunday and 1,372 on Monday, and is expected to show similar levels until the upcoming holiday. When releasing its decision on the social distancing measures to be applied during the Chuseok holiday, Friday, the government is also expected to announce whether the current measures will be extended, as they are set to expire on Sunday. Meanwhile, the country will receive 1.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Romania starting this week as part of a vaccine cooperation program. The European country will send 1.05 million Pfizer doses and 450,000 Moderna doses in two separate deliveries on Thursday and on Sept. 8.\"We are giving our full efforts to administer vaccines to more than 36 million people ― or 70 percent of the population ― at the earliest possible date,\" Lee Ki-il, a senior official at the Ministry of Health and Welfare, said during a briefing, Wednesday. \"The vaccine supply from Romania is expected to help the country\\'s vaccination program proceed more smoothly.\"', 'category': 'nation', 'source': 'koreatimes', 'scrap_time': '2021-09-03 05:18:35'}\n"

ParkInterpark's stock price nosedived on Wednesday, as investors dumped shares in response to major firms dropping their bids for its acquisition. The e-commerce platform company's share price finished at 8,390 won ($7.25), a 12.51 percent fall from the previous day. Market watchers hoped one of the potential buyers ― Yanolja, Kakao or Naver ― could have participated in the bidding for Interpark's acquisition. These big names are said to have received an information memorandum (IM) distributed by NH Investment & Securities, the main underwriter of the sale.The share price, which had skyrocketed recently on expectations for the acquisition deal, fell by more than 16 percent in just two trading sessions. The main reason behind the abandoned bidding process is considered to be questions about the sustainability of Interpark's key business models ― performance reservations and travel booking ― amid the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Another reason for the lukewarm responses from potential bidders is the exclusion from the acquisition deal of the company's lucrative subsidiary iMarketKorea ― a global distributing company focused on industrial goods ― and its bio business department. The selloff deal covers the platform company's tourism, booking, performance and shopping businesses only, as it aims to sell a 28.41 percent stake or 23 million shares held by Interpark Chairman and co-CEO Lee Ki-hyung, who is Interpark's largest shareholder. Interpark plans to spin off its tourism and ticket reservation department as a new company and sell a 100 percent stake in the newly spun-off company to the buyer of the acquisition. Interpark logoConsidering the market cap of Interpark stands at around 700 billion won, and its remaining subsidiary iMarketKorea is worth around 170 billion won, Interpark hopes the selling price would be over 500 billion won. Despite the initial lukewarm response, leading tourism players like Trip.com Group Limited ― China's top travel business formerly called Ctrip.com International ― and Yanolja's industry rival Good Choice Company are said to have strong interest in acquiring Interpark. Both companies would likely see synergy from the acquisition. Trip.com is a Nasdaq-listed company with ticker TCOM, which now accounts for around 60 percent of the Chinese market. As the company expands its scope to the global market, the acquisition of Interpark would be a stepping stone to fully enter into the Korean tourism and ticket reservation market, said stock market analysts. Good Choice Company will be positioned to better trail market leader Yanolja in the leisure business if it acquires Interpark, analysts said. Since CVC Capital Partners, a global private equity and investment firm, took over Good Choice in 2019, the private equity firm has been boosting its corporate value by taking a bolt-on strategy ― referring to the acquisition of smaller companies in the same line of business to increase its strategic value. As part of the strategy, Good Choice acquired MangoPlate, a local restaurant discovery service application, in 2020.\", 'category': 'biz', 'source': 'koreatimes', 'scrap_time': '2021-09-03 05:18:37'}\n",

The enactment comes in line with President Moon Jae-in\\'s reaffirmation of his commitment to carbon neutrality during the 2021 P4G Seoul Summit held in May. The government has also earmarked 12 trillion won (US$10.3 billion) as the budget to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the 2022 state budget plan to be submitted to the assembly on Friday.The legislation stipulates cutting carbon emissions by at least 35 percent by 2030, compared with the 2018 level, as a mid-term goal of the nationally determined contributions (NDC), a non-binding national gas emission reduction pledge.The 35-percent reduction target is 9 percentage points higher than what the country had previously pledged.

YonhapKorea has not executed criminals since 1997By Kang Seung-wooA series of atrocious crimes of late are once again sparking debate over capital punishment. South Korea is classified as \"abolitionist in practice,\" which means that the government retains the death penalty but has not actually executed a criminal in the past 10 years or longer. The last execution here took place Dec. 31, 1997, when 23 convicted of murder were hanged. However, the issue has been brought to the fore again following the homicide of a 20-month-old toddler by her stepfather in June and the murder of two women last month by a sex offender who removed his electronic monitoring anklet while on parole. The 29-year-old stepfather, identified as Yang, allegedly covered the baby girl with blankets because she would not stop crying and punched and stomped her to death. Furthermore, the parents hid the baby\\'s body in an ice box in their bathroom.The crime has drawn public rage especially because Yang allegedly raped and sexually assaulted the toddler, according to autopsy results and the mother\\'s testimony. In the other case, a man surnamed Kang, who had 14 previous convictions, was released from prison in May after serving 15 years for sexual assault, but last Friday and Sunday he killed two women, one of whom was murdered after he destroyed his monitoring anklet. Plus, Kang fanned public anger by not apologizing for his felonies when he showed up in court for the arrest warrant hearing, Tuesday, kicking reporters\\' microphones and saying, \"I regret not killing more people.\"A man who allegedly murdered two women tries to kick reporters while being taken to the Seoul Eastern District Court for his arrest warrant review, Tuesday. YonhapIn the wake of the serious crimes, Rep. Hong Joon-pyo of the main opposition People Power Party repeated his support for capital punishment, Tuesday, saying Yang deserves the death penalty.\"If I\\'m elected president, I will put serious criminals like him to death,\" he wrote on Facebook. Hong, one of the competitive presidential hopefuls in the opposition bloc, also criticized the nation\\'s stance toward the death penalty.\"While proponents of the death penalty are labeled as the extreme right, those who oppose it are praised as human rights activists,\" Hong said.\"In addition, whether to carry out executions is serving as a yardstick to classify between civilized and uncivilized countries.\"He added, \"The United States and Japan have been executing criminals every year; are they uncivilized?\"Debates on whether to abolish capital punishment have continued here, with the Constitutional Court reviewing the issue for more than two years. Abolitionists claim the death penalty is inhumane punishment that undermines human dignity and a state has no authority to deprive the people of the right to life. The National Human Rights Commission of Korea has also taken that stance officially.However, opinions differ even among state organizations. The justice ministry submitted a written opinion to the Constitutional Court in February 2020 favoring capital punishment.\"It cannot be overlooked that the death penalty is still functioning as a necessary evil devised to interlock between human fear of death and the desire to retaliate against crime,\" it said at the time. However, Korea also voted for a United Nations resolution calling for the suspension of the death penalty in November 2020. Previously, the U.N. adopted similar resolutions but Korea abstained out of concerns that it may stir controversy over possible abolition of the punitive measure. As of 2020, a total of 60 criminals remain on death row here.', 'category': 'nation', 'source': 'koreatimes', 'scrap_time': '2021-09-03 05:19:05'}\n",

The passage of the bill could have a \"ripple effect\" around the world, given Google has introduced its in-app payment policy in a number of countries. It will accelerate moves by regulators in the United States and the European Union to diminish the dominant status of platform operators such as Google to provide fairer competition for other entities in the market.Google had planned to introduce in October a policy requiring app developers on Play Store to use its payment system charging a 30 percent fee, while allowing a grace period until next April at the developers\\' request. But the planned introduction of the policy met a strong backlash from app developers, prompting lawmakers in July last year to prepare revisions to the Telecommunications Business Act to bar Google\\'s move.

According to the Korea Mobile Internet Business Association, Google has a 66.5 percent share in the local market, followed by Apple with 21.5 percent and One Store with 11.7 percent.But despite the passage of the bill, Google is expected to seek to charge a fee for app developers that use third-party payment systems, given its planned policy was to collect more fees to increase revenue. Google is set to be pressured to lower the fee substantially below 30 percent, but will still seek a fee as the dominant app market operator.\"We\\'ll reflect on how to comply with this law while maintaining a model that supports a high-quality operating system and app store, and we will share more in the coming weeks,\" Google said in a statement following the bill\\'s passage.But given the moves of regulators around the world, and sentiment against the dominance of platform operators, Google is in a tricky situation.\"Even if app developers are able to use their own payment systems, Google will still likely impose a fee for this.

Courtesy of Shinhan Financial GroupBy Lee Kyung-min Shinhan Financial Group pledged that it will place greater emphasis on convenience, innovation and safety to enhance customer satisfaction ― a new set of goals outlined on its 20th anniversary, which fell on Wednesday. The group\\'s asset total stands at 626 trillion won ($540 billion) as of June, over a 10-fold increase from the 56 trillion won total assets it had at its launch in September 2001. The group\\'s net profit in the first six months of this year was over 2.49 trillion won, up from 221 billion won 20 years ago. Shinhan Bank Vietnam, the group\\'s most lucrative banking subsidiary set up in the Southeast Asian country, ranked first among foreign banks there for the widest network and best financial performance. Its 41 branches reported a combined 58.4 billion won in net profit in the January-June period, up from 57.7 billion won, year-on-year. The figure for the first half accounts for 48 percent of the 120.6 billion won in overseas net profit registered by Shinhan Bank. The gains from global businesses amount to 10 percent of the group\\'s net profit. Shinhan Financial has 16 subsidiaries, including, among others: Shinhan Bank, Shinhan Card, Shinhan Investment, Shinhan Life Insurance, Shinhan Capital, Shinhan Asset Management and Shinhan Savings Bank. It has what it calls a \"matrix of five financial services,\" three of which are global investment banking, pension management and wealth management.

AP-YonhapWith one disastrous inning against the worst team in baseball, Toronto Blue Jays' starter Ryu Hyun-jin suffered his second straight loss.Ryu gave up three earned runs on three hits in 5 2/3 innings in Toronto's 4-2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Rogers Centre in Toronto on Tuesday (local time).Ryu, who struck out six and walked three, took a no-hitter into the sixth inning and got two quick outs before the wheels came off. The Orioles went double-single-walk-double to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 3-1 lead, and Ryu was pulled without completing that inning.Ryu fell to 12-8 for the season, and his ERA went up from 3.88 to a season-worst 3.92.Ryu wrapped up the month of August having allowed 23 earned runs in 33 1/3 innings. This was Ryu's first loss in four meetings against the Orioles, who came into the game at 40-90.Ryu walked the tightrope right from the first inning. He walked the leadoff man Cedric Mullins, who later stole second base ― the first steal against Ryu by any opposing runner this year.With two outs, Ryu threw a wild pitch that allowed Mullins to take third, and then walked Anthony Santander to put runners at the corners.Ryu got himself out of trouble by striking out Ramon Urias and ended up throwing 28 pitches in the opening frame.But Ryu settled down nicely after the hectic first inning, sitting down 15 straight batters after the walk to Santander.He retired the side in order in the second inning on 17 pitches and then needed just 13 pitches combined to sit down six straight batters across the third and fourth innings.Ryu struck out the side in the fifth inning, using three different pitches to do so ― cutter against Pedro Severino, fastball against Jorge Mateo and then curveball to fool Ryan McKenna.Danny Jansen's solo home run to open the bottom third put the Blue Jays up 1-0, and the lead appeared safe, with Ryu looking sharper and sharper as the game progressed.But with two outs in the sixth, Ryan Mountcastle got Baltimore's first hit off Ryu with a double down the right field line. Austin Hays followed up with an RBI single that tied the game and advanced to second on a throw home.Ryu walked Santander on four pitches, and then Urias hit a double to left field to cash in two more runs for a 3-1 lead.The Blue Jays summoned Adam Cimber from the bullpen to take over from Ryu, who, within minutes, went from possibly throwing a no-hitter to being in a position to take the loss.Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo home run to lead off the bottom sixth and cut the deficit to 3-2, only to see the Orioles get a run back in the top seventh for a 4-2 lead.The Blue Jays were silenced over the final three innings as their three-game winning streak came to a halt.

Courtesy of Harry ChunTwo photographers share their experiences about walking alongside people on journeys to seek refuge abroad from their war-torn home countries By Lee Gyu-leeDriven by the fear of the Taliban\\'s inhumane rule following its seizure of Kabul, Afghans have hurriedly fled the country searching for places to live and their exodus has triggered a debate about Afghan refugees around the world. Korea is no exception. The debate over whether or not Korea should accept refugees has been escalating as the anti-foreigner sentiment is still prevalent among Korean citizens. The country welcomed about 390 Afghans, who worked for Korean governmental organizations there, under the banner of \"persons of special merit\" in an effort to avoid stirring negative sentiment among the public against these refugees. Against the backdrop of the intensifying debate, two photojournalists ― Cho Jin-sub and Harry Chun ― hope to correct misconceptions of refugees in the country by sharing their experience of the lives of refugees and to bring the discussion to the table. Their work with refugees was put on display at the photo exhibition \"You Could Have Been Me,\" which was recently held offline in Insa-dong, central Seoul from Aug. 19 to 29. The exhibition, supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has also been held online since last December. \"I wanted to capture their daily lives: eating, sleeping, and carrying on with their life the next day, This is about the same as our own lives, only that we are in different environments. I wanted to capture them and tell their stories which are not any different from ours,\" Cho said during the interview with The Korea Times, at the exhibition, Thursday.

Korea Times photo by Choi Won-sukThe two independent photographers, currently based in Korea, have spent years tracing and delving into the lives of asylum seekers.Cho, who studied at Icart Photo in Paris, covered refugee crises and followed their path along with checkpoints and camps in countries like Turkey and Croatia, as well as their settlement in Germany and France, since 2014. Cho said that he first took interest in refugees and the underprivileged groups as he tried to find an answer to what it means to be happy. \"I\\'ve always asked that question since I was young. And that somewhat selfish question was the start of my career; a vague idea that I will realize how happy I am when I meet people who are in a less privileged environment than I am,\" he said. \"But when I met them, I realized they were not unhappy people. It\\'s just that they are in bad circumstances. Refugees probably live with the biggest hope of their life, a hope for their tomorrow.\"Rohingya refugees are making their way into Bangladesh, in this photo taken in the coastal town Shah Porir Dwip in Teknaf, Bangladesh, Oct. 14, 2017. Courtesy of Cho Jin-subAnd as they carry on with their life, Cho stayed by, not only photographing them but also lending a helping hand with their bags and with building shelters together. \"It\\'s too much to say I\\'ve become part of their life, but they gave me credit for trying, which led them to loosen up in front of cameras and get more comfortable with me being around each other,\" he said. Chun, who graduated from the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, has had a main focus on refugees and conflict zones, including Iraq where he was ambushed by ISIS, and contributed his works to major outlets like NBC and National Geographic.He noted that curiosity had drawn him to cover dynamic scenes and the people in them. \"I was not aware of what\\'s going on around the world. And when I saw all the surprising images and realized they are contemporary, I was shocked to find how different it is from where I live. I got curious and started to learn, and was slowly drawn into this kind of work,\" he said.During ISIS\\'s retreat from Iraq, ISIS used civilians as human shields and took dozens as prisoners. Families were separated during these chaotic moments and were left searching, sometimes in vain, for their loved ones. Courtesy of Harry ChunIn 2015, he traveled with Syrian and Iraqi refugees on a boat across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece and photographed their journey to Germany. \"At first, I tried to document from one side and meet up at another point,\" he said. \"But the big question was how was I going to get in touch with the people (when they go from one point to another) and know when will they arrive. Because I didn\\'t want to miss the moment of them arriving.\"Adding that the two weeks spent on the trip is still one of the best experiences he had as a photojournalist, embarking on that journey has offered him a chance to see the world from the refugees\\' perspective. \"I set only one rule: I will only go when they go. So if they get stuck or stop, I\\'ll stop. That way, I\\'ll really see from their point of view on what it\\'s like to be on this road,\" he said, adding that it made it easier for him to become part of the group. \"There was a lot of drama and emotional moments, especially after we crossed the sea ... there was the one moment I got to see Muslim women ― oftentimes difficult to photograph ― freed from their culture. They were so glad that they made it and actually wanted to be photographed once they saw my camera. They were all full of joy, which of course only lasted for a few minutes until the unpredictable reality of being on foreign soil hit.\" Refugees on a train stare at a camera during a stop at a station in Slavonski Brod, Croatia, Feb. 4, 2016. The refugees received a brief medical checkup before heading to the village of Botovo.

But about things that I cannot control there\\'s no point worrying about them,\" he said.

And as it affected them, they hope to utilize their experience to stir the similar impact and emotions in other people and help change their perception of refugees.\"I totally understand the point of those people who are against them. But, I believe even those people who are strongly against them, if they really see what people go through on the ground, they are not going be as harsh,\" Chun said. \"Maybe they will put it in different ways. Maybe they will say \\'yeah we want to help but our situations\\' like this.\\' That\\'s a bit more what I\\'m hoping that could\\'ve happened here.

Among those in opposition, economic burden and concerns over crimes were the top two reasons. \"Koreans tend to link Middle Eastern refugees with Muslim terrorists and people who suppress women\\'s rights. This could be true but it\\'s not the case most of the time. But Koreans generalize,\" Cho said. \"They only bring up the news highlighting negatives and establish that perception, which is very unfortunate.\" Pointing out the public backlash against Yemenis asylum seekers coming to the country in 2018, Chun added that people should not be fixated only on the negatives. \"Maybe we are finally seeing a chance to have a bit more diversity and have an understanding of what it\\'s like to be in this world. We are so connected nowadays, so why are we so stuck with the idea of being a homogeneous or monoethnic,\" he said. \"We should be able to open up especially coming from a country that only about 70 years ago when its people themselves were refugees.

Courtesy of Harry ChunBoth Cho and Chun expressed their work will serve the purpose if the audiences can find even small relevance and curiosity towards refugee issues. \"What I want from them is not to dismiss this reality after looking at the photos. If it can raise some questions in themselves, that would be the best thing,\" Chun said, noting that\\'s the first step in opening up more dialogue to improve the issue. \"People don\\'t have to experience every single moment of others\\' lives. But at least if I can provide that option with their stories, and if you can find some common elements, despite their religion, situations ― as humans ― and link your life to them, that would be the takeaway that I\\'d hope.\" Taking his family and surroundings as an example, Cho explained that people around him, who were unfamiliar with the refugee crisis, came to learn about the issues through his work, which accomplished the purpose of his work. \"It is too bad how the changes are not as dramatic, but I\\'m still satisfied that it is changing even at a slow pace,\" he said.

Courtesy of Harry ChunTwo photographers share their experiences about walking alongside people on journeys to seek refuge abroad from their war-torn home countries By Lee Gyu-leeDriven by the fear of the Taliban\\'s inhumane rule following its seizure of Kabul, Afghans have hurriedly fled the country searching for places to live and their exodus has triggered a debate about Afghan refugees around the world. Korea is no exception. The debate over whether or not Korea should accept refugees has been escalating as the anti-foreigner sentiment is still prevalent among Korean citizens. The country welcomed about 390 Afghans, who worked for Korean governmental organizations there, under the banner of \"persons of special merit\" in an effort to avoid stirring negative sentiment among the public against these refugees. Against the backdrop of the intensifying debate, two photojournalists ― Cho Jin-sub and Harry Chun ― hope to correct misconceptions of refugees in the country by sharing their experience of the lives of refugees and to bring the discussion to the table. Their work with refugees was put on display at the photo exhibition \"You Could Have Been Me,\" which was recently held offline in Insa-dong, central Seoul from Aug. 19 to 29. The exhibition, supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has also been held online since last December. \"I wanted to capture their daily lives: eating, sleeping, and carrying on with their life the next day, This is about the same as our own lives, only that we are in different environments. I wanted to capture them and tell their stories which are not any different from ours,\" Cho said during the interview with The Korea Times, at the exhibition, Thursday.

Korea Times photo by Choi Won-sukThe two independent photographers, currently based in Korea, have spent years tracing and delving into the lives of asylum seekers.Cho, who studied at Icart Photo in Paris, covered refugee crises and followed their path along with checkpoints and camps in countries like Turkey and Croatia, as well as their settlement in Germany and France, since 2014. Cho said that he first took interest in refugees and the underprivileged groups as he tried to find an answer to what it means to be happy. \"I\\'ve always asked that question since I was young. And that somewhat selfish question was the start of my career; a vague idea that I will realize how happy I am when I meet people who are in a less privileged environment than I am,\" he said. \"But when I met them, I realized they were not unhappy people. It\\'s just that they are in bad circumstances. Refugees probably live with the biggest hope of their life, a hope for their tomorrow.\"Rohingya refugees are making their way into Bangladesh, in this photo taken in the coastal town Shah Porir Dwip in Teknaf, Bangladesh, Oct. 14, 2017. Courtesy of Cho Jin-subAnd as they carry on with their life, Cho stayed by, not only photographing them but also lending a helping hand with their bags and with building shelters together. \"It\\'s too much to say I\\'ve become part of their life, but they gave me credit for trying, which led them to loosen up in front of cameras and get more comfortable with me being around each other,\" he said. Chun, who graduated from the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, has had a main focus on refugees and conflict zones, including Iraq where he was ambushed by ISIS, and contributed his works to major outlets like NBC and National Geographic.He noted that curiosity had drawn him to cover dynamic scenes and the people in them. \"I was not aware of what\\'s going on around the world. And when I saw all the surprising images and realized they are contemporary, I was shocked to find how different it is from where I live. I got curious and started to learn, and was slowly drawn into this kind of work,\" he said.During ISIS\\'s retreat from Iraq, ISIS used civilians as human shields and took dozens as prisoners. Families were separated during these chaotic moments and were left searching, sometimes in vain, for their loved ones. Courtesy of Harry ChunIn 2015, he traveled with Syrian and Iraqi refugees on a boat across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece and photographed their journey to Germany. \"At first, I tried to document from one side and meet up at another point,\" he said. \"But the big question was how was I going to get in touch with the people (when they go from one point to another) and know when will they arrive. Because I didn\\'t want to miss the moment of them arriving.\"Adding that the two weeks spent on the trip is still one of the best experiences he had as a photojournalist, embarking on that journey has offered him a chance to see the world from the refugees\\' perspective. \"I set only one rule: I will only go when they go. So if they get stuck or stop, I\\'ll stop. That way, I\\'ll really see from their point of view on what it\\'s like to be on this road,\" he said, adding that it made it easier for him to become part of the group. \"There was a lot of drama and emotional moments, especially after we crossed the sea ... there was the one moment I got to see Muslim women ― oftentimes difficult to photograph ― freed from their culture. They were so glad that they made it and actually wanted to be photographed once they saw my camera. They were all full of joy, which of course only lasted for a few minutes until the unpredictable reality of being on foreign soil hit.\" Refugees on a train stare at a camera during a stop at a station in Slavonski Brod, Croatia, Feb. 4, 2016. The refugees received a brief medical checkup before heading to the village of Botovo. Courtesy of Cho Jin-subWhen asked if they ever regretted putting themselves in such dynamic scenes, risking lives, Cho and Chun emphasized the experience was worth much more than the danger faces, which they also felt wasn\\'t significant.\"Even though I was in a completely foreign environment with people I\\'ve never met and there was a language barrier, we formed a connection through genuine interactions, which could have not been possible if I was in Korea,\" he said. \"It\\'s not really a sense of duty, but I\\'m just curious to go back and be with them … they are just human beings wanting to survive.\"Adding that he\\'s happiest when in the field, Chun said he never regretted seeking first-hand experience of the scenes. \"I\\'ll prepare everything I can. But about things that I cannot control there\\'s no point worrying about them,\" he said.

Courtesy of Harry ChunSpending time with refugees has left a huge imprint on the two photographers\\' lives and careers. And as it affected them, they hope to utilize their experience to stir the similar impact and emotions in other people and help change their perception of refugees.\"I totally understand the point of those people who are against them. But, I believe even those people who are strongly against them, if they really see what people go through on the ground, they are not going be as harsh,\" Chun said. \"Maybe they will put it in different ways. Maybe they will say \\'yeah we want to help but our situations\\' like this.\\' That\\'s a bit more what I\\'m hoping that could\\'ve happened here. Instead of having all these excuses as to why they should be banned from coming here especially for religious reasons.\"African refugees play games with dice under a streetlight, near the camp named the Calais Jungle in France. The photo was taken on Aug. 12, 2015. Courtesy of Cho Jin-subIn a survey conducted by Hankook Research and UNHCR on 1,016 Korean adults late last year, 53 percent of the respondents answered they were against accepting asylum seekers, whereas 33 percent said they were in favor. Among those in opposition, economic burden and concerns over crimes were the top two reasons. \"Koreans tend to link Middle Eastern refugees with Muslim terrorists and people who suppress women\\'s rights. This could be true but it\\'s not the case most of the time. But Koreans generalize,\" Cho said. \"They only bring up the news highlighting negatives and establish that perception, which is very unfortunate.\" Pointing out the public backlash against Yemenis asylum seekers coming to the country in 2018, Chun added that people should not be fixated only on the negatives. \"Maybe we are finally seeing a chance to have a bit more diversity and have an understanding of what it\\'s like to be in this world. We are so connected nowadays, so why are we so stuck with the idea of being a homogeneous or monoethnic,\" he said. \"We should be able to open up especially coming from a country that only about 70 years ago when its people themselves were refugees. Because you went through and know what it\\'s like to be refugees can you be a little more understanding and feel at least sympathetic and not try to find reasons to ostracize them.\"Iraqi women in Mosul pray immediately after being released from ISIS captivity in this photo taken in April 2017. Courtesy of Harry ChunBoth Cho and Chun expressed their work will serve the purpose if the audiences can find even small relevance and curiosity towards refugee issues. \"What I want from them is not to dismiss this reality after looking at the photos. If it can raise some questions in themselves, that would be the best thing,\" Chun said, noting that\\'s the first step in opening up more dialogue to improve the issue. \"People don\\'t have to experience every single moment of others\\' lives. But at least if I can provide that option with their stories, and if you can find some common elements, despite their religion, situations ― as humans ― and link your life to them, that would be the takeaway that I\\'d hope.\" Taking his family and surroundings as an example, Cho explained that people around him, who were unfamiliar with the refugee crisis, came to learn about the issues through his work, which accomplished the purpose of his work. \"It is too bad how the changes are not as dramatic, but I\\'m still satisfied that it is changing even at a slow pace,\" he said.

      "{'url': 'http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/09/129_314823.html', 'title': \"[Test Drive] Kia's EV6 to redefine local electric SUV market \", 'subtitle': '', 'date': '2021-09-01', 'content': 'Two Kia EV6 vehicles roam the streets of Seoul / Courtesy of Kia Corp.Kia\\'s ambitions are clearly reflected in its newest electric vehicle By Kim Hyun-binKia\\'s ambitions beyond the era of the combustion engine are clearly reflected in its newest electric vehicle (EV). The EV6, which hit showrooms in March of this year, shows just how soon Korea\\'s No. 2 carmaker thinks the era of EVs will dawn. The EV6 will definitely give its sister company, Hyundai Motor, a run for its money by upping the competition in the domestic EV market especially against Hyundai\\'s IONIQ 5, which was unveiled in February of this year.The EV6 recorded the highest first-day pre-order sales for the company by reaching 21,016, while currently over 30,000 have been ordered, far exceeding the company\\'s production target of 13,000 this year.The IONIQ 5 is built more for comfort and is family-oriented, but the EV6 showcases another level of sportiness with an EV that maximizes performance.The company invited a pool of reporters including The Korea Times to take the new SUV out for a spin on Aug. 25.The test drive began at EV6 Unplugged Ground in Seongsu-dong in Seoul, heading for an elementary school located in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, just north of the capital. It was a 143-kilometer round trip that took around three hours to complete.The model that was available was the EV6 Long Range all-wheel drive (AWD).From the exterior, the EV6 went a different route compared to its in-house competitor, the IONIQ 5, which portrayed a futuristic vibe. The EV6 has smooth curves that are gentle on the eyes, as the exterior design is more in line with other models released recently by the company and blends in well with other vehicles on the road.The design embedded a new philosophy called \"Opposites United\" that tries to fuse an innovative crossover bodywork and seamless and sophisticated interior.The EV6 implemented Hyundai Motor Group\\'s Electric-Global Modular Platform?(E-GMP), which is a dedicated EV platform produced by the conglomerate.On the exterior, the E-GMP was used to complete the unique design of the EV6 by adding a digital tiger face to a long wheelbase and short front and rear overhangs, while a dynamic line starts from the lower side and goes through the rear wheelhouse to the tail lamp.EV6 interior / Courtesy of Kia Corp.The interior of the EV6 offers a panoramic curved display that seems to wrap around the driver\\'s seat along with a slim dashboard that gives a more spacious feel from the driver\\'s seat.The EV6\\'s seats are thin and feel lighter than conventional seats. But they are not uncomfortable but rather pleasant feeling when driving.The center console can be opened to reveal a space large enough to store a backpack, tablet PC or water bottles.Another perk was the Active Sound Design technology which was implemented for the first time in a Kia model, offering an enhanced driving experience as the driver can freely select from among three artificial engine sounds: Stylish, Dynamic and Cyber. The sound is linked to the driving mode to add to the driving experience, according to Kia.The EV6 Long Range rear-wheel drive model was certified by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy for its travel range of 475 kilometers on a single charge and being the country\\'s first model to go from a standstill to 100 km/h in just 3.5 seconds in the GT model.The advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) came in handy to drive in the complex urban environment. On the highway was an opportunity to test out the true potential the EV6 had to offer. As soon as the reporter hit the gas, the acceleration was nothing but impressive and incomparably smooth compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, which drastically enhanced the driving experience. This is the very reason why global car manufacturers are vowing to transition their key lineups to EVs.Although the speed was over 100 kilometers, the EV6 was silent as if the vehicle was moving just 30 kilometers an hour. The model has definitely raised expectations for Kia\\'s future EV endeavors and what the later models could bring in terms of performance.The panoramic curved display that connects to the dashboard gave the necessary driving information, while the center display provided mutual assistance and easy control. Heavy rain was encountered during the test drive, but the vehicle\\'s handling was secure and steady.According to Kia, the 800V super-fast charging system can replenish the battery from 10 percent to 80 percent in just 18 minutes.

AP-YonhapBy Lakhvinder SinghThe fall of Kabul has raised the specter of terrorism in India once again. Many Pakistan-based groups have already started approaching the Taliban for help in Kashmir terrorism campaigns, as they used to do during the earlier period of the regime in the late 1990s. Lots of water has flowed through the Indus River and Kashmir today, which was not the case 20 years ago. The Indian government has been working tirelessly to plug all the loopholes which used to provide some space for these groups to operate in Kashmir. In addition, the Indian Army, the third largest military machine in the world, is better equipped than ever before.Changes brought by the Indian government in recent years have transformed the status quo in the region. Despite their best attempts so far, Pakistan-based groups have failed to conjure up a cogent and functional response to the strategic and tactical measures being taken by the Indian government to handle the menace of terrorism in the region. The abrogation of article 370, which was weakening the Indian government\\'s ability to handle acts of terrorism in the region, has effectively changed the regional security situation. As a result, acts of violence have dropped considerably in recent years.The abrogation of article 370 has enabled people to get access to information that was previously restricted to them. As a result, old \"narratives and perceptions\\'\\' are being destroyed and replaced with new ones. Fear instilled by vested interests has evaporated, and people have begun to enjoy the fruits of peace at long last. Doomsday scenarios that threatened ethnic and religious identity have been replaced with hopes of growth and prosperity. Thus, it will be impossible for these rogue elements to gain a foothold again. Gone are the days when innocent people could be easily intimidated.Originally, there were some genuine fears regarding the possibility of large-scale instability, with the changes brought by the Indian government. However, the people responded positively. Even though it brought some hardships and somewhat dented India\\'s democratic traditions, people here were able to see and connect with the bigger picture. People who were yearning for peace and growth for decades realized that their moment had come. They did not take long to seize it.Today Indian security forces have strengthened their dominance over terrorists. Hundreds of foreign-sponsored terrorist groups have been terminated in recent years, while the support structure and network have been completely dismantled. This proactive approach by Indian security agencies has effectively disrupted the funding mechanisms and security loopholes, and the \"Line of Control\" has been completely plugged by installing the latest surveillance resources.The government has also focused on sanitizing internal governmental administration mechanisms by dismissing government employees involved in sabotage activities and by creating a new synergy between various stakeholders who operate as one team to improve the lives of the people. For the first time in recent memory, internal conflicts and contradictions in the administration, due to various factors, have been aligned and channeled in one direction. As a result, the region is growing once again.Constitutional changes introduced by the Indian government brought some political acrimony initially. However, as the clouds of doubt surrounding the policies and ground measures dissipated, most of the state and local political leaders have started gathering behind the government. With this entire political landscape completely changed, a new generation of the political leadership is emerging, which is ready to dump old narratives and test new ideas for the growth and prosperity of the nation. Today, a new dawn of progress and prosperity awaits the region. Apart from more than $10 billion in special development packages, other developmental schemes, such as \"Back to Village\" and \"My Town My Pride,\" are ushering in rapid and equitable progress. Many new infrastructure projects being laid down by the government and new capacity-building projects launched locally are writing a new growth story for the region. The time for Kashmir\\'s place in the sun has come.These changes initiated by the Indian government have brought to the forefront new opportunities for the people of the region. An updated and functional security network, the rejuvenation of young political leadership, a more efficient and pro-people local administration, as well as infrastructure and real-time engagement with average citizens on the ground, have initiated a paradigm shift. The socio-political environment that had provided a breeding space for these elements has been completely transformed.Acknowledgment of the changing equation in Afghanistan has been a challenge, but the Indian government has been rethinking its strategy on how to handle the rise of the Taliban and new emerging alliances between Afghanistan, Pakistan and China. A new alliance of democratic forces to counter the regional spread could be the next logical step. There is no way that democratic forces can now close their eyes to what is happening in the region. A swift and effective response is just a matter of time.India is ready to lead this effort.Lakhvinder Singh is the director of the peace program at the Asia institute in Seoul.', 'category': 'opinion', 'source': 'koreatimes', 'scrap_time': '2021-09-03 05:20:13'}\n"

This proactive approach by Indian security agencies has effectively disrupted the funding mechanisms and security loopholes, and the \"Line of Control\" has been completely plugged by installing the latest surveillance resources.The government has also focused on sanitizing internal governmental administration mechanisms by dismissing government employees involved in sabotage activities and by creating a new synergy between various stakeholders who operate as one team to improve the lives of the people.

On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Australia and Korea, the Seoul International Women\\'s Film Festival (SIWFF) sheds light on the history of women\\'s filmmaking in Australia, in cooperation with the Australian Embassy in Korea. Australian Ambassador to Korea Catherine Raper welcomed the special program to mark the 60th anniversary.\"Advocating for gender equality is a priority for Australia. I hope this program not only promotes some truly fantastic Australian women\\'s films and the creative exchanges taking place between our two countries, but also serves as an opportunity for the Republic of Korea and Australia to continue working together toward gender equality in the film industry,\" Raper said. Women\\'s filmmaking practices in Australia have a century-old history, beginning with Kate Howarde, actress and director of \"Possum Paddock,\" and the first female to direct a feature film in Australia in 1921, and Lottie Lyell, the actress who wrote and directed, \"The Blue Mountains Mystery,\" also in 1921, and was a pioneer in the film business with the establishment of Longford-Lyell Productions.Twelve films directed by Australian women were shown at the SIWFF, which ran from Aug. 26 to Sept. 1. Paulette McDonagh\\'s 1930 film, \"The Cheaters,\" which gives a glimpse into the early works of Australian female directors, was shown with Korean musician Lee Joo-young\\'s live performance.The works of prominent filmmakers Gillian Armstrong and Jane Campion, from the 1980s, as well as more contemporary films by Jennifer Kent and Rachel Griffiths, were also screened during the SIWFF.On Aug. 27, a forum titled, \"Australian Women\\'s Filmmaking: HerStories and Policies,\" discussed the wide spectrum and history of Australian film, centering on the roles and influences of women in the film industry there.Lisa French, professor of the School of Media and Communication at RMIT University, Melbourne, presented the history of women in Australian film, as well as how female directors reflect their views and experiences in their works. French directed a documentary short, \"The Female Gaze: Women Directors Talk,\" which accompanied the publication of her book, \"The Female Gaze in Documentary Film: An International Perspective,\" earlier this year. \"Each woman filmmaker will have her own individual gaze and specific worldview or aesthetic approach. When I refer to the female gaze, I\\'m talking about the representation that is produced by a woman who identifies as female and wants to communicate her gendered experience. This festival has a catchphrase: \\'see the world through women\\'s eyes.\\' And that\\'s exactly what the female gaze is ― seeing women\\'s reality from women\\'s perspectives,\" French said.\"Since the earliest days of cinema, they have passionately engaged with every kind of subject, community aesthetic and approach. They work in all genres and styles, and have told diverse stories. Although the nation\\'s cinematic output has been very masculine, telling stories of male adventures from male perspectives, today Australia has an international reputation for supporting and nurturing female filmmakers, and women practitioners have played a major role in international perceptions of the Australian film industry.\"French explained how female filmmakers such as Armstrong and Campion, as well as Shirley Barrett, Sue Brooks and Cate Shortland, shaped Australian cinema, which is famous for offering women\\'s perspectives on screen.\"Australia is a country that has been growing constantly through migration, and is characterized by a multicultural identity. Films by women over time have shown a keen interest in the stories of migrant outsiders struggling to gain a place in the world,\" French said.Georgie McClean, director of the creative consulting company, Gist, who previously served as acting CEO of the Australian Film Television and Radio School, gave a presentation about \"Gender Matters,\" which refers to the efforts of the Australian government film support, development and promotion organization, Screen Australia, to address the underrepresentation of women in key creative roles in the film industry, and to achieve a 50:50 gender ratio in the industry by 2030.As Screen Australia looked into statistics on participation in the screen industry based on gender, they found that women were still as underrepresented in 2015 as they were in the 1970s. \"If you look at female directors of feature film, they hadn\\'t really moved from around 16 percent participation in all that time. This obviously was a significant problem for the industry, because it means that the range of stories and a range of perspectives have not been told,\" McClean said. They sought to understand the barriers stopping women from participating in key roles in the sector.\"The first of these barriers was identified as key decision makers, the people who hold the gatekeeping roles across the industry. ... Next, and very importantly, and I\\'m sure something that many of you will identify with, is the fact that women tended to take on a much heavier burden in carrying the responsibilities of domestic work,\" McClean explained. McClean also noted that studies have found that women were lacking in the aggressive tendency that men might have to put themselves forward in certain situations.\"This was a little bit of a controversial finding or barrier, as it meant that, as Deb Verhoeven said, the onus was placed on women to change themselves rather than on the industry,\" McClean said.Screen Australia came up with measures to support women in every stage and changes to the assessment criteria, which aims to have 50 percent of creative roles in the funded projects filled by women. It was a self-imposed target, rather than a quota. Through mentorship, policies for increasing support for women\\'s careers and efforts to remove unconscious biases from decision makers, the campaign garnered some visible results. \"I can happily say that in 2021, we were able to reveal that 57 percent of key credit roles were now held by women across Screen Australia-funded projects, which is really significant.

The toughened measure came as the country has confirmed 3,455 more cases of four major contagious variants of the new coronavirus over the past week, including 3,427 of the highly transmissible delta variant.The caseload of such infections reached 20,297 here, with the number of delta cases, first reported in India, tallied at 16,881, according to the KDCA.

Among them, 402 were female members, accounting for about 82.5 percent of the total. The Army said it was the largest number of female NCOs enlisting at a single induction ceremony, adding that it was a result of the military's Defense Reform 2.0, a comprehensive reform initiative aimed at creating a slimmer yet stronger military to counter future security threats, which includes a policy of expanding the ratio of female service members.Among the newly enlisted NCOs, some received attention for their family backgrounds related to the military.

There are many original shows that can compete with quality licensed musicals and the large production companies which have been making licensed musicals and plays are planning to come up with more original musicals in the future.\"', 'category': 'art', 'source': 'koreatimes', 'scrap_time': '2021-09-03 05:21:22'}\n",
