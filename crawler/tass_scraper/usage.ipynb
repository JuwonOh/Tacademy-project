British Prime Minister Boris Johnson thinks the diplomatic recognition of the Taliban movement (outlawed in Russia) by the West is possible but the radical movement should fulfill a number of conditions. \"If the new regime in Kabul wants diplomatic recognition, or to unlock the billions that are currently frozen, they will have to ensure safe passage for those who wish to leave the country, to respect the rights of women and girls, to prevent Afghanistan from, again, becoming an incubator for global terror, because that would be disastrous for Afghanistan,\" the PA news agency quoted the prime minister as saying on Sunday. \"Together with our allies in America and Europe and around the world, we will engage with the Taliban not on the basis of what they say but what they do,\" the British prime minister said. On August 15, Taliban fighters swept into Kabul without encountering any resistance, and gained full control over the Afghan capital within a few hours. Afghanistan`s President Ashraf Ghani said he had stepped down to prevent any bloodshed and subsequently fled the country. Vice President Amrullah Saleh announced that, in the absence of the head of state, the constitution empowered him to become the caretaker president and urged the Afghan people to join the resistance against the Taliban. The armed resistance in the country`s Panjshir Province is led by Ahmad Massoud, the son of renowned guerilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud (1953-2001). At present, Western nations are evacuating their citizens and embassy staff. Last weekend, the UK completed the evacuation of its citizens and many Afghans who assisted them over the past 20 years.', 'category': 'world', 'source': 'Tass (Russaia)', 'scraping_date': '2021-08-30-35 04:29:02'}\n",

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will participate in an international video conference on Afghanistan on Monday where he will present UK`s priorities on this track, diplomatic sources told a TASS correspondent on Sunday. The meeting will be held at the initiative of the US with the participation of G7 countries (the UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, the US, France, Japan) as well as Qatar, Turkey and NATO representatives. According to the sources, the British priorities that the diplomat will present include \"preventing Afghanistan becoming a haven for terrorists; responding to the humanitarian plight; safeguarding regional stability; and holding the Taliban to account on human rights.\" \"In particular, he will stress the importance of ensuring the Taliban stand by their commitment to allow safe passage for foreign nationals and Afghans authorized to enter third countries,\" the diplomatic sources said. It is expected that the British top diplomat will also set out some principles of London`s future interaction with the Taliban movement (outlawed in Russia) which should be built \"on a pragmatic basis, responsive to the actions of the Taliban, not just their words, and coordinated across the international community with as broad a coalition as possible,\" the sources said. After the Biden administration had announced the end of Washington`s 20-year-long military operation in Afghanistan and the launch of its troop pullout, the Taliban embarked on an offensive against Afghan government forces. On August 15, Taliban fighters swept into Kabul without encountering any resistance, and gained full control over the Afghan capital within a few hours. Afghanistan`s President Ashraf Ghani said he had stepped down to prevent any bloodshed and subsequently fled the country. Vice President Amrullah Saleh announced that, in the absence of the head of state, the constitution empowered him to become the caretaker president and urged the Afghan people to join the resistance against the Taliban. The armed resistance in the country`s Panjshir Province is led by Ahmad Massoud, the son of renowned guerilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud (1953-2001).

The Taliban movement (outlawed in Russia), which has seized power in Afghanistan, is seeking to aggravate the humanitarian situation in the northern province of Panjshir that is refusing to recognize the Taliban, a source in the region told TASS on Sunday. \"The humanitarian situation in Panjshir is stable so far, but the Taliban are seeking to worsen it. They are blocking access to the state-run electricity supplies system. So far, there is enough electricity here, which is generated thanks to local rivers,\" the source said. Apart from that, according to the source, the Taliban have switched the region off the national telecommunications system and have partially blocked mobile internet. \"Moreover, the Taliban sometimes block roads leading to the province. There are risks that they will block food and fuels supplies, as they did in the [neighboring] Baghlan province,\" he noted. Abdul Hafiz Mansoor, who represents Panjshir at talks with the Taliban, said on Wednesday that the first direct talks between delegations from the National Resistance Front (NRF) and the Taliban radical movement had been held in the city of Charikar (the capital of Parwan Province - TASS). According to Mansoor, the sides agreed to continue peace dialogue in order to avoid armed confrontation. Fahim Dashti, spokesman for the resistance movement, told TASS on Thursday that an agreement on cessation of hostilities with the Taliban was only being negotiated. He said that Panjshir disagrees with the idea of introducing a \"symbolic representation of ethnic groups in the government\" and insists on forming truly inclusive government bodies.

The Contact Group on settling the situation in eastern Ukraine introduced additional measures that have been in effect since July 27, 2020 to control the ceasefire in Donbass. Under the agreement, the conflicting parties in Donbass are prohibited from carrying out offensive, reconnaissance and subversive operations, using any types of aircraft, opening fire or deploying heavy weapons in populated localities. One of the key provisions is the use of disciplinary measures for ceasefire violations. Furthermore, any retaliatory fire in the event of an offensive is allowed only after a commander's direct order. Despite these accords, the situation in Donbass has worsened since late February. Intensive exchanges of gunfire re-ignited on the engagement line, resulting in casualties on both sides. Kiev pins the blame on the Donbass republics for the escalation.

A Reuters source also noted that crowds in front of the gates to the airport began to dissipate after reports of likely new terrorist attacks. The evacuation of civilians is scheduled to be completed on Sunday, the agency was told. Earlier, US President Joe Biden announced that the US military considered a new terrorist attack on the Kabul airport in the next 24-36 hours very likely. United States forces were dispatched to Kabul airport to evacuate US citizens, foreigners, and refugees from Afghanistan. The US authorities intend to complete the evacuation operation and withdraw forces from Afghanistan on time - by August 31. On August 26, militants of the Islamic State in Khorasan group (an offshoot of the Islamic State terrorist organization banned in Russia) staged a terrorist attack near the Kabul airport, which killed more than 200 people, including 13 US soldiers. The situation in Afghanistan escalated after in April US President Joe Biden announced his decision to end the military operation in the republic. After that, the militants of the radical Taliban movement (outlawed in Russia) increased the pace of the offensive and on August 15 without a fight for several hours established full control over Kabul.

The US plans to complete the evacuation from Afghanistan on August 31, despite the recent events in the republic, the Pentagon spokesman john Kirby stated Friday. \"Weâ€™re still planning on ending this mission at the end of the month. And as I said the other day, as we get closer and we are getting closer, youâ€™re going to see us begin to make those muscle movements to pull out our troops and some of our equipment as appropriate with any retrograde,\" Kirby said. He added that the US would continue to provide aid to the Afghans, but there will be no US military presence in the republic in the future. \"Though, we will not have a military presence there, the United States government will still want to see what we can do with the international community to make sure that Afghans can have the best of all possible outcomes for their future,\" the spokesman said. Kirby underscored that the Pentagon intends to maintain as many opportunities to ensure security in Kabul as possible for as long as possible. \"What we want to do is preserve as much capability for as long as we can, both in terms of the security footprint, but also in terms of the ability [â€¦] to move out evacuees,\" he said. The Pentagon spokesman also said that \"the US military do not rule out more attacks in Kabu and are prepared for that.\" \"We certainly are prepared and would expect future attempts,\" he said. \"We\\'re monitoring these threats, very, very specifically, virtually in real time.\" On August 26, two blasts rocked an area near Kabul`s airport, via which Western nations are evacuating foreign citizens.

The United Nations Security Council has approved a statement condemning the August 26 terror attacks in Kabul and calling for the perpetrators, organizers and backers of the terrorist attack to be held responsible, according to a statement issued at the UN on Friday. The council members asserted that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations represents one of the more serious threats to international peace and stability. \"Deliberately targeting civilians and personnel assisting in the evacuation of civilians is especially abhorrent and must be condemned,\" said the council, emphasizing the need to hold the perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors accountable. The statement noted that the Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) organization (outlawed in Russia) claimed responsibility for the attacks. The role of the Taliban movement (outlawed in Russia) was not mentioned in the statement. The members of the council also \"reiterated the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan to ensure the territory of Afghanistan should not be used to threaten or attack any country, and that no Afghan group or individual should support terrorists operating on the territory of any country.\" They emphasized the necessity for all countries to fight the threats to international peace and security represented by terror attacks using all means possible in accordance with the UN Charter and other obligations, including international humanitarian law, international refugee law and human rights. The statement also underlined the necessity to ensure the security of UN personnel in Afghanistan as well as the diplomatic staff of UN member countries. The UN Security Council \"called on all relevant parties to respect and facilitate the safe evacuation of civilians.\" The document did not touch on political issues, including the recognition of the Taliban government, as well as on the deadlines of evacuation from Afghanistan. On August 26, two powerful blasts triggered by suicide bombers occurred near the building of Kabul airport used by Western countries to evacuate foreign citizens. According to the latest information, 170 people were killed in the terror attack, including 13 US servicemen.', 'category': 'world', 'source': 'Tass (Russaia)', 'scraping_date': '2021-08-30-35 04:40:30'}\n"

Before preaching down to others, Warsaw should pay more attention to human rights in its own migration policy, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Friday on her Telegram channel. Commenting on the migration crisis at the Polish-Belarusian border, the Russian diplomat noted that \"the reality of the human rights routines of the Polish colleagues\" runs counter to the values Warsaw declares \"theoretically, on paper.\" She recalled that thousands of migrants from \"instability-gripped countries that have fallen victims of the Western geopolitical projects are seeking to reach the European Union,\" including Poland. According to the Russian diplomat, these people have a \"moral right\" to demand humanitarian assistance, since Polish troops were also deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and at the Syrian border on the Turkish side. \"One might think that it is a perfect chance to demonstrate the real concern of human rights, to show the entire world how it should be: to organize a modern tent camp for refugees on its territory (but not in words), or, for instance, to test the most advanced, newest methods of inclusive integration in the spirit of the international human rights movement,\" she noted. \"But Poland has chosen another way. It deployed troops, including regular army units, to the border with Belarus, built fences with barbed wire along its section of the border, flings all those who manage \"to infiltrate\" into internment camps, and seeks to push these poor people back to Belarus.\" However, in her words, these measures seem not to be enough for Warsaw, which is currently thinking about how to reform its migration laws to simplify the deportation of migrants and abandon the practice of considering asylum applications from many categories of people. Answering a question if Warsaw has any right to this \"sovereign migration policy,\" Zakharova noted that such a policy \"must be in keeping with Warsaw`s international liabilities\" and \"must not run counter to the moralism Polish officials afford in respect of sovereign states.\" \"Or the other way round: Warsaw lives as it likes and stops teaching anyone how they should live,\" she added.', 'category': 'world', 'source': 'Tass (Russaia)', 'scraping_date': '2021-08-30-35 04:40:33'}\n",
