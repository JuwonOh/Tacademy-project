He said that the Global Development Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping is an important manifestation of the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind, and Iran firmly supports and will actively participate in it.Wang Yi said, the sixth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee summed up the achievements and basic experience of the CPC over the past century, and also provided an important impetus for China to move towards the second centenary goal. China has successfully embarked on its own path of modernization, created a new form of human civilization and opened up new avenues for developing countries to pursue modernization. China has no intention of exporting its development model, but is willing to provide a reference for Iran and other countries that want to speed up development while maintaining independence. China stands ready to work with Iran to oppose all acts of unilateralism and bullying, uphold the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and safeguard international fairness and justice.Wang Yi said, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Iran. President Xi Jinping and President Ebrahim Raisi had good strategic communication, which pointed out the direction for the development of bilateral relations. China appreciates Iran\\'s support for the Global Development Initiative, and is ready to work with Iran to implement the comprehensive cooperation plan and push for new achievements in the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership. To demonstrate its friendship with the Iranian people, the Chinese government has decided to donate another batch of vaccines to Iran.Wang Yi said that the so-called \"Summit for Democracy\" proposed by the United States is, in essence, to instigate division in the world under the banner of democracy, incite bloc confrontation with ideological lines, and attempt to carry out American-style transformation of other sovereign countries to serve the strategic needs of the United States itself. This practice goes against the trend of the times and is doomed to have no future.Abdollahian said, Iran and China have overcome the difficulties of the pandemic, supported and helped each other, achieved fruitful results in practical cooperation and carried forward the traditional friendship between the two peoples. China\\'s decision to donate additional vaccines to Iran is highly timely, for which the Iranian side deeply appreciates. The plan for Iran-China comprehensive cooperation pushes bilateral relations to a new stage. Iran is willing to deepen exchanges and cooperation with China in various fields. Iran resolutely opposes unilateralism and bullying acts, double standards and interference in China\\'s sovereignty and internal affairs. The Iranian side condemns the politicization of sports events and believes that the Beijing Olympic Winter Games will be a complete success.The two sides exchanged views on the Iranian nuclear issue. As the Vienna talks are about to restart, Wang Yi said, pushing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) back on track will usher in new opportunities and also face severe challenges. China welcomes Iran\\'s recent invitation to Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Mariano Grossi to visit Iran, sending a positive signal to the outside world. The Chinese side understands the reasonable demands of the Iranian side and supports Iran in safeguarding its legitimate rights and interests. Under the current situation, all parties should make joint efforts to maintain the momentum of resuming talks and push for consensus in the Vienna talks.Abdollahian appreciated China\\'s constructive role in resuming the Vienna talks and said that the Iranian side is serious about resuming the implementation of the JCPOA and is willing to participate in the talks with a positive attitude. The Iranian side attaches importance to the achievements of the talks so far and believes that the JCPOA is the starting point and basis for resuming the talks. Iran thanks China for upholding justice in the Iranian nuclear issue and international affairs, and is willing to continue to strengthen communication and coordination with China.The two sides also exchanged views on the situation in Afghanistan, and agreed to strengthen coordination and cooperation to jointly promote the Third Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan next year to achieve positive results, so as to give play to the unique role of neighboring countries, and contribute to the long-term peace and stability of Afghanistan.', 'url': 'https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/wshd_665389/202111/t20211125_10453079.html', 'source': 'china foreign ministry', 'scrap_time': '2021-11-27 06:36:39'}\n",

The Palestinian side attaches great importance to China\\'s suggestions and hopes to strengthen coordination and communication with China in this respect to push for an early and just settlement of the Palestinian question.Wang Yi said that the Palestinian side\\'s notification demonstrates the brotherly friendship and mutual trust between China and Palestine. The Palestinian question has always been the core question of the Middle East. Only when the Palestinian question is justly resolved, can the Middle East region truly achieve peace and security. China holds that the most fundamental solution to the Palestinian question is to return justice to the Palestinian people. The international community should uphold the \"land for peace\" principle, adhere to the \"two-state solution\" and work for the early establishment of a fully sovereign, independent State of Palestine based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. The urgent affairs neededâ\\x80\\x82to be doneâ\\x80\\x82are as follows. First, the authority of the Palestinian National Authority should be enhanced, and it should be authorized to exercise sovereign functions in security, finance and other areas, so as to gain effective control over the autonomous and occupied territories. Second, the Palestinian factions should be supported for greater unity, whereby they can achieve internal reconciliation through consultation and dialogue, and come to a unified position on talks for the settlement of the Palestinian question. Third, Palestine and Israel should be encouraged to resume peace talks based on the \"two-state solution\". China supports the Palestinian side\\'s idea of holding an international peace conference and calls for the holding of the international peace conference led by the Unitedâ\\x80\\x82Nations with the participation of the permanent members of the UN Security Council and all stakeholders in the Middle East peace process. China also welcomes Palestine and Israel to hold direct negotiations in China.Wang Yi stressed that China always stands on the side of peace, reason and justice on the Palestinian question, adding that President Xi Jinping has put forward proposals multiple times for a comprehensive, durable and just settlement of the Palestinian question. So long as the Palestinian question remains unresolved, China will not stop its efforts to promote peace talks, and will continue to uphold justice for the Palestinian side on international and multilateral occasions and stand firmly with the Palestinian people in the quest for the establishment of an independent state.Wang Yi pointed out that since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Palestine, bilateral relations have been developing steadily and the friendship between the two peoples has continuously deepened. China thanks the Palestinian side for its firm support in a series of issues concerning China\\'s core interests. Over the years, China, within its capacity, has been actively helping the Palestinian side develop its economy and improve its people\\'s livelihoods, and will continue to provide humanitarian, anti-pandemic and development assistance in accordance with the Palestinian side\\'s needs.Amr said that the Palestinian side highly appreciates China\\'s impartial stance on the Palestinian question, and thanked China for its long-term valuable material and moral support to the Palestinian people.

These important remarks reflected the Chinese leader\\'s deep thinking on the evolution of the China-U.S. relations, and they also outlined the framework for its development in the future.Mutual respect is a basic precondition for state-to-state relations.

President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Kishida have reached important consensus that the two countries should build a relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. The two sides should make plans based on the consensus, and take the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan diplomatic ties next year as an opportunity to advance the bilateral relationship along the right track towards long-term stability.Wang Yi pointed out, the Communist Party of China (CPC) successfully convened the sixth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee earlier this month, which stressed the CPC has always paid attention to mankind\\'s future and destiny from a global perspective and has always stood on the right side of history and the side of human progress. China and Japan are major countries in the region and the world\\'s second and third largest economies respectively. Both sides should jointly conform to the major trend of times and hold on to the right direction for bilateral ties to benefit both peoples in a better way, and inject more positive energy into Asia and the world at large. China hopes that the Japanese side will observe the principles set out in the four political documents between China and Japan, view China\\'s development objectively and rationally, and put the political consensus that the two countries are \"cooperative partners and not threats to each other\" into policies and actions. Japan should make sure that there will be no wavering, backtracking, and line-crossing on major issues concerning history, Taiwan and others, which matter the political foundation of China-Japan relations and basic trust and faith between the two sides.Wang Yi said, the two sides should strive to achieve a higher level of complementary advantages, mutual benefit and win-win results, jointly maintain the stability of global industrial chains and supply chains as well as a fair and open trade and investment environment, and promote the high-quality development and improvement of the people\\'s well-being in both countries. The two sides should fully leverage the unique advantages of geographical proximity and cultural affinity, and take the Beijing Olympic Winter Games and the China-Japan Cultural and Sports Exchange Promotion Year in 2021 and 2022 as an opportunity to create a positive public opinion and social atmosphere. As important countries in the region, China and Japan should be aware of each other\\'s international responsibilities, jointly practice true multilateralism, and resist any attempt to provoke separation, confrontation or even a new Cold War. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will come into effect in January next year, and China and Japan will reach bilateral tariff reduction arrangements for the first time. Both sides should make joint efforts to lead the process of promoting regional cooperation and integration in Asia.Wang Yi pointed out, Japan and the United States are allies, while China and Japan are neighbors that cannot be moved away. China and the United States are communicating on strategic issues concerning the future of the two countries. China hopes that Japan can grasp the general trend, bear in mind the common interests of Japan and the region, and properly handle its relations with China and the United States.Yoshimasa Hayashi said, at present, the international community is in a period of major changes. Asia is increasingly important, and China has been developing rapidly. The international community has paid more attention to and expects more from Japan-China relations. Japan is willing to work with China to take the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries next year as an opportunity to strengthen dialogue and exchanges, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, enhance people-to-people exchanges, properly manage differences, shoulder the responsibilities in confronting global challenges, implement the consensuses such as \"not threats to each other\" and advance the building of stable and constructive Japan-China relations.Wang Yi expounded on China\\'s principles and stance on issues concerning the Diaoyu Islands, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.The two sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues of common concern.', 'url': 'https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/wshd_665389/202111/t20211119_10450368.html', 'source': 'china foreign ministry', 'scrap_time': '2021-11-27 06:37:10'}\n",

President Xi Jinping put forward the vision for building a community with a shared future for mankind. China is willing to work with all parties to fight against the pandemic, boost economic recovery, and keep the industrial and supply chains stable and unimpeded. China will firmly uphold the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the UN Charter, safeguard the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, and enhance the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment. It will strengthen international macro policy coordination, uphold global financial stability, and promote steady recovery of the world economy.Li Keqiang introduced the current economic situation in China. He said, since the start of this year, we have coordinated COVID-19 responseâ\\x80\\x82with economic and social development, maintained the overall momentum of economic recovery, but we also face new downward pressure. China is the biggest developing country, and the fundamentals sustaining its long-term economic growth remain unchanged. China's market entities have reached 150 million, creating over 700 million jobs, which explains why China's economy remains resilient and vibrant, and strongly stabilizes employment. We will maintain a stable macroeconomic operation, refrain from unleashing a deluge ofâ\\x80\\x82strong stimulus policies, take the needs of market entities into consideration when making and implementing macro policies, roll out more combined tax and fee cut measures in a timely manner, deepen reforms to streamline administration, delegate powers, and improve regulation, fuel market vitality and internal driving forces for economic growth, and help market entities, especially the large number of small, medium and micro-sized enterprises, overcome difficulties. We will follow the requirements of grounding our work in the new stage of development, applying the new development philosophy, fostering a new pattern of development and pursuing high-quality development, enhanceâ\\x80\\x82cross-cyclical adjustments, keep major economic indicators within an appropriate range, and ensure long-term and steady growth of the economy.Li Keqiang pointed out, China's economy has been deeply integrated into the world economy. Opening-up is a fundamental state policy of China. China will unswervingly expand opening-up, promote multi-field and multi-level international cooperation, create a business environment that is market-orientated, law-based and up to international standards, treat various market entities equally, and protect intellectual property rights in accordance with the law. China, a big global market and an important investment destination, welcomes enterprises from around the world to invest and do business here.Li Keqiang appreciates foreign enterprises' support for China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive, and emphasizes that the world economy will embrace a bright future as long as we confront difficulties with confidence and uphold openness, inclusiveness, solidarity and coordination.Following his remarks, Li Keqiang answered the questions of entrepreneurs. While talking about the energy supply issue, Li Keqiang said, to address recent shortages of electricity and coal, a series of measures have been taken and the energy shortage has been relieved, with the future energy supply guaranteed. On the basis of our national conditions, we will promote a low-carbon transition in a balanced and orderly manner on the precondition of ensuring a stable and safe energy supply.
